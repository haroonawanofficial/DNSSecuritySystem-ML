- **Centralized Storage and Data Records Processing:** Designed for use in large data centers, small and medium-sized businesses with segmented or constrained networks, or public-facing IP addresses.

## Trained Machine Learning Model
- Anomaly Detection: The trained model can effectively identify anomalies in DNS data, such as unusual patterns or suspicious activity, which may indicate security threats.
- Predictive Analysis: It can predict and classify DNS-related events, enabling proactive security measures.
- Automation: The model can automate the analysis process, saving time and resources for security analysts.
- Accuracy: With proper training, the model can provide accurate results and reduce false positives.
- Customization: Training the model on your specific DNS data allows it to adapt to your network's behavior and detect deviations from the baseline.
- Enhanced Security: It provides a tailored approach to DNS security, focusing on the types of threats that are most relevant to your network.
- Continuous Improvement: Regular retraining with new data ensures that the model remains effective against evolving threats.

## Benefits of Using an SQLite Database:

- Data Storage: SQLite allows you to store DNS-related data efficiently, making it accessible for future analysis and reporting.
- Scalability: You can manage a large volume of DNS data without significant performance degradation.
- Querying and Reporting: SQLite enables efficient data retrieval for generating reports and monitoring DNS traffic patterns.
- Data Persistence: Data is retained even if the tool is restarted, ensuring historical DNS data is available for analysis.

## Benefits of Reporting Capabilities:

- Visualization: Reporting provides visual representations of DNS data, making it easier for security analysts to understand and interpret trends and anomalies.
- Historical Analysis: Reports allow for the review of historical DNS traffic patterns, aiding in identifying patterns and potential security issues.
- Alerting: Reporting can trigger alerts when unusual DNS activity is detected, enabling a swift response to potential threats.
- Compliance: Reports can help organizations meet compliance requirements and provide evidence of DNS security measures.


## Purpose

ML DNS Security System is intended for organizations and professionals who want to continuously monitor DNS health, detect anomalies, and enhance DNS security measures. It provides a proactive approach to safeguarding your DNS infrastructure.
