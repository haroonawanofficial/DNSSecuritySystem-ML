# ML DNS Security System

Machine Learning DNS Security System is a robust, defensive solution for DNS monitoring, anomaly detection, and enhancing DNS security. This tool automates data collection, employs machine learning for anomaly detection, and offers features like neighboring DNS discovery and non-contiguous IP scanning. It is design for ongoing DNS monitoring, anomaly detection, and enhancing DNS security. This tool focuses on defensive measures to ensure the integrity and security of your DNS infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Defensive Focus:** Built for DNS security, data collection, and anomaly detection.
- **Automation:** Designed for continuous, automated operation.
- **Broad Capabilities:** Provides DNS data collection, anomaly detection, machine learning, data storage, neighboring DNS discovery, and non-contiguous IP scanning.
- **Data Storage:** Stores DNS records and anomalies in an SQLite database.
- **Subdomain Discovery:** Supports limited subdomain discovery.
- **DNS Zone Transfer:** Supports DNS zone transfer.
- **SOA Record Retrieval:** Retrieves SOA records for target domains.
- **Custom Anomaly Checks:** Allows custom anomaly checks.
- **Neighboring DNS Servers:** Analyzes neighboring DNS servers.
- **Non-Contiguous IP Scanning:** Scans for non-contiguous IP space.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes machine learning for identifying DNS anomalies for scan, attacks and discoveries, keeping the track to protect DNS infrastructure.

## Purpose

ML DNS Security System is intended for organizations and professionals who want to continuously monitor DNS health, detect anomalies, and enhance DNS security measures. It provides a proactive approach to safeguarding your DNS infrastructure.
